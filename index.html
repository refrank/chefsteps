I was the liaison between developers, business clients, stakeholders and users. Each group has their own language, jargon and communication style. It was my job to translate and bridge the gap.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted skills-copy">Design is in my blood. My artist grandfather gave me regular art and design lessons starting at age 2. I won numerous art/design awards in high school. I'm constantly creating both physical and digital projects for fun and for work. I love the intersection of deciding what should be built, how it should work and what it should look like.</p>

					<p class="text-muted skills-copy">I've done a few small projects using HTML/CSS, including this one, but I'm still fairly new to it. I'm comfortable making mockups and prototypes in Balsamiq, UXPin and Protoshare to name a few. The bit of coding I've done whetted my appetite. I always push myself to learn new things so if this is how you need your prototypes built, I'll be sure to come up to speed quickly.</p>

					<p class="text-muted skills-copy">I know how to get things done on time. For three years I worked on a web app for the U.S. Veterans Affairs and we shipped a slew of releases. I also run my own recipe site, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.veritablyveg.com/">Veritably Veg</a>, and help my fiancé with his startup, <a target="_blank" href="http://sightreadingmastery.com/">SightReadingMastery</a>. I'm intimately familiar with getting stuff shipped and out the door. I put out products I'm proud of while not letting perfect be the enemy of good.</p

                    <p class="text-muted skills-copy">When I was in college and still figuring out what I wanted to do in life I had two formative internships. One of them was working at a major advertising firm as a brand management intern for The Home Depot. I also worked at Food & Water Watch, a consumer advocacy non-profit. This gave me a good foundation in knowing how to get a message out there and the importance of staying true to brand identity to build brand recognition.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted skills-copy">When I was 12 my parents got me an Alton Brown cookbook. It was my favorite Christmas present. When I was a teenager I would stay home and teach myself to cook instead of going to parties. I fell asleep reading books on the science and chemistry of cooking. Food is more than a lifelong passion for me; it's a way of life. I love pushing my boundaries, expanding my repertoire, and sharing what I've learned with others. It's who I am.</p>

I learned all the ins and outs of business ownership, process improvement, management and so much more. Oh and I was trained to pull shots and steam milk by a World Champion Barista.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Become the Coursera of the cooking world by offering comprehensive video series.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/CookingSeries.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
							<strong>The Background<br><br></strong>
							The classes offered by ChefSteps are amazingly high quality, inventive and really set the bar high for anyone looking for resources to learn new cooking methods. In addition to the individual courses currently offered, I think a specialization, or series of courses, could add a lot of additional value to customers and could be a premium product which brings in higher revenue than the one-time classes.<br><br>
							<strong>The Idea<br><br></strong>
							ChefSteps could expand its video learning catalog to include course specializations and become the Coursera of the cooking world. What ChefSteps already offers is extremely high quality content that doesn't just entertain the viewer, but informs and teaches as well. ChefSteps could take its teaching to the next level and expand its customer base by creating comprehensive course series. These would be courses that took a learner from A-Z on a specific topic and would be presented in multiple videos, perhaps with "try at home" assignments. The customer would be taken on a journey from novice to expert and benefit from a structured syllabus instead of a la carte skills and techniques. This is a special niche that cooking shows, recipe sites and YouTube channels aren't filling.<br><br>
							When approaching a new subject, it can be hard to get the lay of the land. An experienced cook already has a mental model in place and knows where to file away new tricks they learn. " 'Blend sautéed corn with liquid ingredients to make my cornbread more awesome!' Filing that away in the baking section of my brain." But before your own structure is in place, it's nice to borrow someone else's, especially that of a trusted, professional chef.<br><br>
							Examples of these video course series could be comprehensive beginner's guides like "Everything You Need to Know about Cooking", "Everything You Need to Know about Baking" to seasonal courses like "How to go from never touched a knife before to hosting Thanksgiving dinner for 25 people" and "Grilling: Beyond just Hot dogs".<br><br>
							These course series would be offered as a package and customers could be offered a price slightly lower than paying for each individual course, yet ChefSteps could do all the filming in one fell swoop and then charge a premium for the total combined content.

                            <p>
							<strong>The Background<br><br></strong>
							There are times when you just need to learn by doing. Make mistakes, try to fix them, rinse and repeat. But there are also times when you're truly stuck and don't know what to do next.<br><br>
							<strong>The Idea<br><br></strong>
							ChefSteps could offer a subscription service where customers can call and talk to a real chef a certain number of times a month. This would decrease the fears and barriers people have for trying advanced techniques and would not require any new content creation for ChefSteps.<br><br>
							A service like this would really open up the cooking world and tear down the walls between the trained experts and the timid newbies. This would increase ChefSteps reputation as not only a thought-leader in the content they provide, but as approachable, knowledgeable kitchen allies who are most interested in helping everyone learn how to make delicious food.<br><br>
							This service could also provide valuable data and insight into the pain points of ChefSteps customers. It could potentially influence future classes and content allowing ChefSteps to better meet the needs of their userbase.<br><br>
							Also, recurring revenue is awesome.

                            <p>
							<strong>The Background<br><br></strong>
							ChefSteps could expand its affiliate partnerships and increase revenue by creating packages targeted at people who want to outsource the research on every kitchen item they need but still want high-quality tools.<br><br>
							<strong>The Idea<br><br></strong>
							It can be overwhelming to start a new hobby, to know what to learn first and what you need to start practicing. Kitchen tools are investments and people don't want to buy an item that will not meet their needs. ChefSteps could lend their years of experience in the kitchen and provide recommendations on products that are tried and true. This will provide an easy way for people to buy everything they need to set up their kitchen with the guarantee that the pieces are recommended by professional chefs, all while ChefSteps increases its bottom line with the additional revenue stream.<br><br>
							ChefSteps could create several different packages, one for cooking, one for baking, and other specialty packages that correspond with the classes offered. There could be a link between the video course series and the kitchen tools packages, for instance if a customer signed up for the "Everything you need to know about Baking" course series, then ChefSteps could recommend their Complete Baker's Package to that customer who is already a warm lead.<br><br>
							The items that make up the total package will be high quality and could be marketed as a wedding gift, a house warming present or just an easy way to ensure customers get what they need to create exceptional food at home.
